“Did you know that acquiring a new customer is 5 to 25 times more expensive than retaining an existing one?” That’s why customer churn is one of the most urgent and expensive problems facing subscription-based businesses—especially in the telecom industry, where competition is fierce and switching is easy.
In this project, I used Tableau to analyze a fictional telecom dataset from Databel, uncover key churn drivers, and present actionable insights using interactive dashboards.

🔍 Objective of the Analysis
💬 The goal of this case study was not just to calculate the churn rate—but to go deeper:
Who is churning?
Why are they churning?
What can businesses do to reduce churn proactively?

Using Tableau’s advanced visual and filtering capabilities, I designed a 4-part dashboard story that answers these questions through clear storytelling and data-backed insights.

 Overview of Dashboards & Key Insights

1️⃣ Dashboard: Churn Overview

Churn Rate: 26.86% across 6,687 customers
Top reasons: Better competitor offers, poor support experience, dissatisfaction
Actionable takeaway: Telecoms must improve customer service touchpoints and loyalty programs to stay competitive.

Churn increases sharply after age 60, peaking above 50% in the 70+ segment
Group plan holders churn significantly less than individual users
Strategy tip: Offer long-term plans and family bundles tailored to older customers

Customers with Unlimited Plans but low usage churn at high rates (50%+)
71% churn among customers who have an international plan but don’t use it
Business implication: Mismatched plans lead to dissatisfaction; there's opportunity in recommending better-fit plans

Direct Debit + Month-to-Month contract holders have highest churn (54%)
Longer account tenures are consistently linked with lower churn, regardless of payment method
What it means: Retention strategies should reward longevity and nudge customers toward longer commitments

Conclusion: What This Means for Stakeholders
💬 This analysis goes beyond visual storytelling—it surfaces clear, actionable insights for decision-makers in telecom and subscription-based industries:
🔑 Key Business Takeaways:
📉 Churn isn’t random—it’s highly concentrated among:
🎯 Contract length matters: Customers with longer tenures and group plans churn significantly less. → Use loyalty programs, targeted discounts, and bundling to encourage commitment.
📊 Behavior ≠ plan alignment: Many users pay for features they don’t use—or incur costs they could’ve avoided with the right plan. → Use usage data to offer personalized plan recommendations or trigger proactive outreach.
🔍 Customer support signals risk: Tracking service calls and tenure together could help predict and prevent churn early.

Strategic Opportunities:
Automate churn risk detection using behavioral data
Design a plan recommendation engine to match customers with ideal services
Create dashboards like these for real-time churn monitoring
Encourage group/family plans and reward long-term contracts

🧠 In short, churn isn’t just a number—it’s a diagnosis. And dashboards like these are the diagnostic tool leaders need to reduce churn, improve loyalty, and drive long-term customer value.
